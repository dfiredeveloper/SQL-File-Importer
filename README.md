# SQL File Importer

Used for importing SQL files into database. This saved me a lot of time importing sql files right through the phpMyAdmin dashboard, all i need to do was to fire up my servers and visit the index page and select exported sql file.

**Todo**

- Add ability to select database without touching the code
- Improve functionalities
- Better UI/UX
